🎵 SongMate
SongMate is an API-based music companion tool built with FastAPI that enables users to:

  ==> 🎶 Download audio from YouTube videos and playlists as MP3 files using yt-dlp.

  ==> 📝 Fetch song lyrics from Genius.com using headless browsing and web scraping (Playwright / DuckDuckGo parsing).

  ==> 📂 Provide clean, ready-to-use download links through a simple API interface.

The project uses Docker for containerized deployment, making it portable and production-ready.

🔑 Key Features:
  🔍 Song lyrics scraping using Playwright or fallback DuckDuckGo parsing to bypass bot detection.

  🎧 Supports both single song and full playlist audio downloads.

  ⚙️ FastAPI backend for scalable and maintainable API development.

  🐳 Dockerized for quick deployment on cloud platforms like Google Cloud Run.
